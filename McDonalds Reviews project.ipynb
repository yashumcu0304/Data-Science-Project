    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the highly competitive quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry, customer experience is a decisive driver of brand reputation, operational performance, and customer retention. Despite McDonald’s highly standardised operating model across the United States, customer experiences vary substantially across store locations and time periods, reflecting underlying spatial, temporal, and operational heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional customer satisfaction assessment methods, including surveys and internal audits, are limited by low scalability, delayed feedback, and rigid evaluation frameworks. These approaches fail to capture real-time, unsolicited customer perceptions. Conversely, online customer reviews provide a large-scale, temporally continuous, and geographically distributed source of unstructured textual data that encapsulates authentic consumer sentiment. However, the volume, noise, and linguistic complexity of such data introduce significant analytical challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing research in the QSR domain predominantly prioritises numerical ratings while underexploiting the semantic richness of review text and largely ignoring spatio-temporal variation. The absence of integrated sentiment, spatial, and temporal analysis restricts a comprehensive understanding of customer experience dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research addresses this gap by applying advanced natural language processing and spatio-temporal analytics to large-scale online review data, enabling a unified examination of sentiment patterns across McDonald’s U.S. stores. The study aims to generate data-driven insights that support targeted operational improvements and strategic decision-making."

    "\n",
    "The aim of this research is to systematically analyse customer experiences across McDonald’s stores in the United States by integrating large-scale online review data with sentiment analysis and spatio-temporal analytics, in order to identify underlying patterns, temporal trends, and key determinants of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction."

    "\n",
    "- To systematically quantify customer sentiment from large-scale online textual reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and evaluate its relationship with numerical star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To investigate spatial heterogeneity in customer satisfaction by identifying and analysing geographic patterns across McDonald’s store locations within the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To analyse temporal dynamics in customer sentiment and ratings in order to detect longitudinal shifts in customer perceptions and service performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To evaluate variations in customer experience across store categories and assess the extent to which store type influences sentiment polarity and rating distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To identify recurring service-related themes and operational issues through sentiment-driven thematic analysis of customer review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To derive robust, data-driven insights that support evidence-based operational optimisation and service quality enhancement within the quick-service restaurant industry."

    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study was collected through systematic web scraping of Google Reviews associated with McDonald’s store locations across the United States. It comprises both structured data—such as store attributes, geographic coordinates, numerical ratings, and review timestamps—and unstructured textual customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "All reviewer identifiers were anonymised at source, ensuring compliance with ethical research practices and data protection standards. The dataset captures a large-scale and diverse range of real-world customer experiences over an extended temporal span, making it well suited for sentiment analysis, spatial examination, and temporal trend analysis. The absence of personally identifiable information (PII) permits the responsible use of the data for academic research purposes."
